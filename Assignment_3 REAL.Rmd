knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

2. Importing csv file and naming it rna_counts
```{r}
rna_counts <- read.csv("eXpress_dm_counts.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```
2.Coding a function that can take the mean of individual column, with the additional option of log2transformation. 
```{r}
col_mean_cs1 <- function(x, log2transform = FALSE) {
  if(log2transform == FALSE) {
    mean(rna_counts[, x])
  } else {
    loged <- log2(rna_counts[, x])
    loged[!is.finite(loged)] <- NA
    mean(loged, na.rm= TRUE)
  }}
```
2.Demonstration on Column 1 LOG, 
```{r}
col_mean_cs1(2,TRUE)
col_mean_cs1(2,FALSE)
col_mean_cs1(5,TRUE)
col_mean_cs1(5,FALSE)
```
3. Loop to generate a vector containing mean expresion values for each column 
```{r}
my_vector = c()
 for(i in 2:ncol(rna_counts)) {
   my_vector[i-1] = col_mean_cs1(i,FALSE)
   names(my_vector)[i-1] = colnames(rna_counts)[i]
 }
View(my_vector)
```
4. lapply
```{r}
my_vector_apply =c()
unlist(lapply(2:ncol(rna_counts), col_mean_cs1))

```

5. lapply function is easier
